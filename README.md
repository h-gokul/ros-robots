This repo contains several ROS packages of the robots I designed/worked with during my robotics master's program. 



Robots in this repository:

# snake-robot
- a 10 DOF teleoperable snake robot with various gait configurations. We also modified the setup to 6DOF robotic arm with base fixed to ground, and performed inverse kinematics validation.

# leader-follower turtlebots
- Two obstacle avoidance turtle bots setup in a leader-follower configuration with April Tags.

# rover
- teleoperable rover modelled in solidworks with steering wheel integrated with a lidar.
