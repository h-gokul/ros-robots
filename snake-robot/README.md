## Contributions:
#### Pratik Acharya - CAD modelling and Inverse Kinematics  
#### Gokul Hari - Urdf parsing and building for publishers teleoperating various gait configurations.


## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:

## - Test the gait motions in various terrains 
## - Configure inverse kinematics with a more fancier URDF model.
